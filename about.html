            I attended a scientific high school.
            It was interesting until the start of the third year, 
            when chemistry and biology were still integrated with physics 
            and required logical thinking.
            Then, it became just a memorization of rules, behaviours
            and nomenclature and I stopped studying them.
            (Btw, I still have interest in biology
            and have continued to read about it from time to time,
            but for now it is postponed).<br/>
            Luckly, at least for me, on march of the third academic year
            there was the first quarantine for Covid and
            so I found myself at home with no school and no soccer.
            And what did I do in this period? I read many books of various topics.
            And, I'm not even sure why, but at a certain point pops to my mind the idea 
            of creating a blog about sustainable energy and electric cars.
            Hence, I searched on the Internet how to create a website and 
            I discovered Wordpress. The free version sucked and so I decided to 
            program my own website.
            While programming I was adding more and more features to the website
            and after a while I was just adding stuff for the seek of programming.
            Something clicked with the programming activity and so I dropped
            the blog idea and I continued programming random stuff.<br/>
            4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> year passed without any particular event for me.
            Some periods I was programmimg, some other period I was
            studying some specific subject.<br/>
            Anyway, at the start of the 5<sup>th</sup> year I did not know
            if I wanted to continue studying or starting working.
            But, I felt I still wanted to explore and so I took the engineering test to get admitted to the 
            University of Trento and study computer science.

            I finish high school and on september I move to Trento.<br/>
            The most important thing about moving to Trento
            was not for the studies themselves (I could choose Pisa), 
            but for the independence from my parents: managing expenses, buying food,
            doing the laudary, etc.<br/>
            Also, I was living in a student residence and there I had the 
            possibility to meet many international students from different
            backgrounds and cultures.<br />
            Instead, about studies aspect, not everything clicked to me
            but few subjects intrigued me particularly 
            (at the moment of the classes or in hindsight): 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

            After less than a year I already wanted to try something new
            so, on the 3<sup>rd</sup> semester I moved to Estonia
            as an <a href="https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/">Erasmus+</a> Student.<br />
            There, I was also in a different cultural environment
            and in a land with a different weather to which I never got used to :).
            The university was structured in a different way compared to Italy, but
            I will not talk about it. There I learned two things in particular:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How to configure a switch and create a LAN
            </li>
            <li>
                how to build an IT infrastructure:

            </li>

            Little after I came back to Trento
            I started my first internship. Frankly,
            not an easy experience. Basically it was: 
            "Hey, the infrastructure of our credit unions was built
            in COBOL over a period of 40 years and never updated.
            We would like to translate it into Java".
            Indeed, I wrote an article about it: 
            <a href="https://medium.com/@alessandrotambellini03/my-experience-migrating-legacy-code-985b63841363">

            Currently I'm interested in browsers and I'm creating webapps/games to explore the browser API 
            as much as possible. I'm also continuing uni, but at a slow peace given I'm interested
            just in a couple of classes.
