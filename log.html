            <p>
                Sometimes I like to right click web pages to take a look at the source code. In most cases it's a miserable blob of nested <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s without any sense.<br>
                I remember one month ago taking a look at the Porsche website made in Next.js and immediately after watching the 2025 Vercel Conference (The company behind Next.js).
                In the conference they basically said: "Well, crawlers and agents are not able to scan our websites and so we thought about creating the text-based representation of the content of a page
                in parallel to the page itself, specific for the crawlers"... I think they missed the problem. Are they really that blind or is it just a question of interests? Or am I just naive?<br> 
                Now, my follow-up question is, is it possible to create a complex website while mantaining the html semantic? 
                And perhaps without uploading and downloading gigabytes of JS blob?
                And perhaps without all the crazy, high-end, ultra-powerfull, magic, astonishing frameworks and libraries?<br>
                This is my answer: <a href="https://github.com/AlessandroTambellini/Post-Stream">https://github.com/AlessandroTambellini/Post-Stream</a>.
                It's a try.

            <p>
                Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare, 
                talks about AI bots and publishers.<br>
                Some of the points he makes are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>AI bots consequences for publishers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Subs aren't sold</li>
                        <li>Ads aren't seen</li>
                        <li>People don't visit the publisher page -> no ego/fame</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>People create content to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make money</li>
                        <li>Get fame</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>And here are my considerations:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The more a page has "fame", the more it's crawled by the bots.<br>
                    The more a page is linked and cited, the more it's crawled by the bots.<br>
                    The more a page has fame, the more its content has a chance to be in an LLM answer.
                    And I think sharing the message/opinion/point-of-view
                    is more important than fame per se.
                </li>
                <li>"Ads aren't seen" and "Subs aren't sold" are the same problem: money.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                So, given I don't see the ego/fame point as a problem, everything comes down to the money aspect.
                And so, what's the consequence? That you don't earn by writing on the web &#8658; 
                no clickbait, no ads, free content, more independent publishers and less corporate publishers. 
            </p>

                Read <cite><em>A Programmable Web: An Unfinished Work</em></cite>, by Aaron Swartz.<br>
                It makes a bunch of interesting points related to: openess of data, API design, structure of URLs, 
                Digest access authentication built-in HTTP, stateless web, robots & crawlers.

                Yesterday I started building a browser. 
                I'll see where it goes.
                The first phase is going to be about experimentation.

            <p>
                Today I read 
                <a href="https://htmlparser.info/#table-of-contents">Idiosyncrasies of the HTML parser</a>.<br>
                To be precise, I read the first two chapters and skimmed the third one.<br>
                What I understood is that the HTML parser of browsers is built to handle any type of 
                "writing style" plus, without ever throwing an error. In the style of: 
                "Hey, don't worry, however you write it's fine and we are never gonna throw you an error!".<br>
                It remembers me of an interview to Brendan Eich where he says that from the first draft 
                of JS the equality operator <code>==</code> was the strict equality one but then, people persuaded
                him to make it loosely equal.<br>
                Were these decisions made to let people populate the web in the easiest way possible without 
                worrying about the programming barrier?<br>
                I can draw a parallel with the decision of YouTube to remove the dislike button at the cost
                of lowering the quality of the content "to let people express fearlessly".
                Translated: to populate YouTube.
