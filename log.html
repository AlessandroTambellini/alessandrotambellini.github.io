                Who needs package managers, build tools, and YAML files?
                Just copy-pasted the code I needed and deployed directly from the main branch: 
                <span class="static-link">https://github.com/AlessandroTambellini/3d-matrix-visualizer</span>.
                <br>
                Consequences?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>It saves a lot of developer's time (at least mine)</li>
                <li>The codebase is cleaner</li>
                <li>
                    The website is easily debuggable from the DevTools: no hashing of filenames, bundles and minifications. 
                    And no, the website isn't slower because the problem isn't my little scripts of hundreds of lines of code.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                See the difference with the previous approach:

                <code>position: sticky;</code> isn't just about making a good visual effect for a navbar.
                It allows to save on containers, allowing the HTML to be more semantic.
            </p>
            <p>Snippet from my project 'Post Stream':</p>
            <p>Before:</p>
            <!-- <pre class="code"> -->
            <code class="code-block">
&lt;main&gt;                
    &lt;h2&gt;Posts&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div id='replies-container'&gt;
        {{ post-cards }}
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;
            </code>
            <!-- </pre> -->
            <p>After:</p></code>
            <!-- <pre class="code"> -->
            <code class="code-block">
&lt;main&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Posts&lt;/h2&gt;
    {{ post-cards }}
&lt;/main&gt;
            </code>
            <!-- </pre> -->
            <p>
                In this specific case the goal is to scroll the posts while manteining the title visible.
                Thanks to <code>sticky</code> I can do it without relying on a container with scrolling properties.

                Today I took a look at Facebook: the DevTools was lagging so much I wasn't even able to navigate the source code.
                Btw, the nested <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s test is passed: 11 divs to reach a button on the front page.

                    Today I took a look at Claude.ai and just this little code snippet generated in the chat is more than 6KB of HTML.
                    Moreover, it has 17 opening <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags but 27 closing <code>&lt;/span&gt;</code> tags. Go figure.
                    And of course, I had the same laggish experience as with the Facebook code.

            <p>
                Sometimes I like to right click web pages to take a look at the source code. 
                In most cases it's a miserable blob of nested <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s without any sense.<br>
                I remember one month ago taking a look at the Porsche website made in Next.js and, 
                immediately after, watching the 2025 Vercel Conference (The company behind Next.js)
                where they basically said: 
                "Well, crawlers and agents are not able to scan our websites and so we thought about creating the text-based representation 
                of the content of a page in parallel to the page itself, specific for the crawlers"... 
                Instead of questioning their JS blob on the frontend, they come up with this solution. 
                Are they really that blind or is it just a question of interests? Or am I just naive?<br> 
                Now, my follow-up question is, 
                is it possible for a complex website to be semantic? 
                And perhaps without uploading and downloading gigabytes of JS blob?
                And perhaps without all the crazy, high-end, ultra-powerfull, magic, astonishing frameworks and libraries?<br>
                This is my modest try: 
                <a href="https://github.com/AlessandroTambellini/Post-Stream">https://github.com/AlessandroTambellini/Post-Stream</a>.<br>
                Also, a website, more precisely a website of the Web 2.0, performs 4 main actions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get user data via a form</li>
                <li>Manipulate the data for storage/retrival</li>
                <li>Store/Retrieve the data into/from a database</li>
                <li>Show the data</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="img-placeholder display-none"></div>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img src="assets/log/website-scheme.webp" alt="Website Scheme">
            </div>
            <p>
                If these actions are performed by using what the web offers (URL, HTTP, HTML), 
                it's pretty straightforward to implement such a system.<br>
                But, to make a bit easier to control some UI state, 
                some people decided to adopt a model called Single Page Application.
                A model where the easiness of manipulating data by exploiting the change of page is lost 
                at the cost of what I already said before.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just to make an example, this is the readability and easiness of analysis of a page of my project in the browser:
            </p>
            <!-- <a href="assets/log/sources-tree.webp">
                <img src="assets/log/sources-tree.webp" alt="Source Tree">
            </a> -->
            <div class="img-placeholder display-none"></div>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img src="assets/log/sources-tree.webp" alt="Source Tree">
            </div>
            <div class="img-placeholder display-none"></div>
            <div class="img-wrapper">
                <img src="assets/log/html-code.webp" alt="HTML Code">
            </div>

            <p>Can you have the same clarity in React.js?</p>

            <p>
                Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare, 
                talks about AI bots and publishers.<br>
                Some of the points he makes are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    AI bots consequences for publishers:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Subs aren't sold</li>
                        <li>Ads aren't seen</li>
                        <li>People don't visit the publisher page -> no ego/fame</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    People create content to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make money</li>
                        <li>Get fame</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>And here are my considerations:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The more a page has "fame", the more it's crawled by the bots.
                    The more a page is linked and cited, the more it's crawled by the bots.
                    The more a page has fame, the more its content has a chance to be in an LLM answer.
                    And I think sharing the message/opinion/point-of-view
                    is more important than fame per se.
                </li>
                <li>"Ads aren't seen" and "Subs aren't sold" are the same problem: money.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                So, given I don't see the ego/fame point as a problem, everything comes down to the money aspect.
                And so, what's the consequence? That you don't earn by writing on the web &#8658; 
                no clickbait, no ads, free content, more independent publishers and less corporate publishers. 
            </p>

                To be precise, I read the first two chapters and skimmed the third one.<br>
                What I understood is that the HTML parser of browsers is built to handle any type of 
                "writing style" plus, without ever throwing an error. In the style of: 
                "Hey, don't worry, however you write it's fine and we are never gonna throw you an error!".<br>
                It remembers me of an interview to Brendan Eich where he says that from the first draft 
                of JS the equality operator <code>==</code> was the strict equality one but then, people persuaded
                him to make it loosely equal.<br>
                Were these decisions made to let people populate the web in the easiest way possible without 
                worrying about the programming barrier?<br>
                I can draw a parallel with the decision of YouTube to remove the dislike button at the cost
                of lowering the quality of the content "to let people express fearlessly".
                Translated: to populate YouTube.
